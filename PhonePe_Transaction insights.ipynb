Additionally, XGBoost offers **built-in regularization**, handles **imbalanced data well**, and is capable of modeling complex, non-linear patterns in transactional behavior, making it the most robust and reliable model for final deployment.\n"

To interpret the model’s behavior and feature influence, I used SHAP, a powerful explainability tool that reveals how each feature contributes to model predictions. The SHAP summary plot highlighted that log_amount, log_count, and transaction_type were the most important features, aligning well with business logic. This transparency not only validates the model's reasoning but also builds stakeholder trust in using the model for real-world decision-making."
